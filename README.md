In this Pandas mini project we will talk specifically about Matlplotlib and some of its features. 

This project consists of a Google Colab notebook filling done concurrently with the classes of the course Python Pandas: processing and analyzing data, taught by instructor Rodrigo Fernando Dias from Alura.

You will find out a bit about some graphs, such as scatter, hist, plot and bar, and their applicability.
